# ERD
![ERD model](doc/erd.png)
Note: also avaliable as PDF in `docs/erd.pdf`  
It was generated using the gem `rails-erd` by running the command
```bash
rails erd indirect=true attributes=foreign_keys,primary_keys,content filetype=pdf filename=doc/erd
```

# Deployment
Deployment is pretty straight forward. You will need a running postgres server and the ruby and rails versions mentioned above under [used versions](#used-versions).

## Clone repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrila/time-travelling-turtle.git
```

## Install gems
```bash
cd time-travelling-turtle
bundle install
```

## Run migrations
Make sure that the postgres server is running.
```bash
rails db:migrate
```

## Run seed
If desired, you can populate the DB with test data.
```bash
rails db:seed
```

## Start the server
```bash
rails s
```

## Open website
http://localhost:3000
